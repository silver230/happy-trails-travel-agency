    <h2 class="tropical">Did you know that travelling can make your life better and happier in several ways?</h2>
    <p>Travel is good for lots of things, but it can also increase mental well-being - and not just in the short-term. Whether you’re traveling for business, on a one-week family holiday, or have sold everything to pursue a life on the road, traveling can make you a happier person by building self-confidence, providing new experiences and memories, breaking routine and allowing you to meet people from all over the world.</p>
    <p>The various benefits of travelling are:</p>
      <ul class="stacy">
        <li class="subtitle"><strong>It teaches you about the world</strong></li>
        <em>The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” – said Saint Augustine.</em> Travelling can teach you more than any university course. You learn about the culture of the country you visit. If you talk to locals, you will likely learn about their thinking, habits, traditions and history as well.
        <li><strong>It teaches you about your homeland</strong></li>
        If you travel, you will not only learn about foreign cultures, but about your own as well. You will notice the cultural differences, and will find out what makes your culture unique. After retrurning from a long journey, you will see your country with new eyes.
        <li><strong>It teaches you about yourself</strong></li>
        You can learn a lot about yourself through travelling. You can observe how you feel beeing far from your country. You will find out how you feel about your homeland. You will realise how you really feel about foreign people. You will find out how much you know/do not know about the world. You will be able to observe how you react in completely new situations. You will test your language, orientational and social skills. You will not be the same person after returning home.
        <li><strong>It makes you more tolerant</strong></li>
        During travelling you will meet people that are very different from you. If you travel enough, you will learn to accept and appreciate these differences. Traveling makes you more open and accepting.
        <li><strong>It provides you with unforgetyable moments and experiences</strong></li>
        Some of my most cherished memories are from the times when I was travelling. If you travel, you can experience things that you could never experience at home. You may see beautiful places and landscapes that do not exist where you live. You may meet people that will change your life, and your thingking. You may try activities that you have never tried before.
